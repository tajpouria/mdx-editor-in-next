**Task:** Evaluate the Summary or Objective statement of a resume for its tailoring and relevance to a provided job description.

**Resume Text:**

**Job Description:**

{{job_description_text}}

**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Tailoring Score (1-10):** Assign a score from 1 to 10 based on the summary/objective's level of tailoring to the specific job description.

   - **10 (Excellent):** Summary is highly customized, directly addresses key requirements and desired qualifications in the job description, and immediately showcases the candidate's value for _this specific role_. It effectively uses keywords and demonstrates a clear understanding of the employer's needs.
   - **1 (Very Poor):** Summary is generic, lacks any specific connection to the job description, presents a weak or unclear value proposition, and misses opportunities to use relevant keywords.

2. **Justification for Score:** Provide a concise explanation for the assigned score. Specifically address:

   - **Specificity & Relevance:** How specifically and directly does the summary address the requirements and desired qualifications outlined in the job description?
   - **Value Proposition Clarity:** How clearly and persuasively does the summary articulate the candidate's value proposition _for this particular role_ based on the job description?
   - **Keyword Integration:** To what extent does the summary incorporate relevant keywords and phrases from the job description?

3. **Actionable Improvement Tips:** Provide 2-3 concrete and actionable tips to enhance the summary/objective's tailoring. These tips should:
   - **Suggest Specific Keywords/Phrases:** Recommend 1-2 specific keywords or phrases _from the job description_ that the candidate should incorporate.
   - **Focus on Value-Driven Revisions:** Advise on how to rephrase sentences to more directly highlight skills and experiences that are explicitly mentioned or implied as valuable in the job description.
   - **Emphasize Role-Specific Language:** Guide the candidate on using language that directly speaks to the needs and expectations of someone in _this particular role_.

**Desired Output Format:**

Score: [Score 1-10]
Justification: [Concise explanation of the score, addressing specificity, value proposition, and keywords]
