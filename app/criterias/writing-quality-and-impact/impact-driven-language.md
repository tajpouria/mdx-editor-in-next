Evaluate the resume text below for the effective use of **impact-driven language**. This means assessing how well the resume focuses on **achievements, results, and positive outcomes**, rather than simply listing tasks and responsibilities. Effective impact-driven language clearly demonstrates the **value and contributions** of the candidate.

**Instructions for AI:**

1.  **Impact Score (1-10):** Assess the overall effectiveness of the resume's language in demonstrating impact and results. Use the following scale:

    - **10 = Excellent:** Consistently uses strong impact-driven language. Clearly quantifies results with data and metrics. Focuses almost entirely on achievements and outcomes.
    - **7-9 = Good to Very Good:** Strong use of impact language in most areas. Some quantification of results. Mostly focuses on achievements but may occasionally list tasks without clear outcomes.
    - **4-6 = Fair:** Mix of task-based descriptions and some attempts to highlight results. Limited quantification. Impact is sometimes implied but not explicitly stated.
    - **1-3 = Poor to Very Poor:** Primarily describes tasks and responsibilities. Little to no focus on results or impact. Lacks quantifiable metrics.

2.  **Reason for Score (with Examples):** Provide a concise explanation for the assigned score. **Specifically:**

    - **Identify 1-2 sentences or phrases that effectively demonstrate impact and results.** Explain _why_ these are strong examples of impact-driven language.
    - **Identify 1-2 sentences or phrases that are primarily task-focused and lack impact.** Explain _how_ these could be improved to emphasize results.
    - **Comment on the overall balance between task descriptions and impact statements in the resume.**

3.  **Actionable Improvement Tips:** Provide 3-5 specific and actionable tips to enhance the resume's impact-driven language. Focus on the following categories:
    - **Focus on Results:** Suggest strategies for transforming task-based descriptions into achievement-oriented statements.
    - **Quantify Impact:** Encourage the use of numbers, metrics, and data to demonstrate the scale and significance of achievements. Provide examples of how to quantify different types of accomplishments.
    - **Use Strong Action Verbs:** Recommend using powerful action verbs that highlight achievements and contributions (e.g., "led," "managed," "increased," "improved," "developed").
    - **Rephrase Task-Focused Language:** Offer concrete examples of how to rephrase specific task descriptions from the resume to be more impact-driven. Show "before" (task-based) and "after" (impact-driven) examples, ideally drawing from the provided resume text.

**Desired Output Format:**
Score: [Score 1-10]
Reason: [Explanation of score with positive and negative examples, and comment on overall balance]
