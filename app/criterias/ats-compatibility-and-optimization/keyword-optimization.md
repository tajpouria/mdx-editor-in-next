Analyze the resume for keyword optimization in relation to the job description to enhance its chances of passing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and attracting recruiter attention.

**Resume Text:**

<%= resume_text %>

**Job Description:**

<%= job_description_text %>

**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Keyword Optimization Score (1-10):** Assess the level of keyword optimization. Score based on the **relevance**, **density**, and **strategic placement** of job description keywords within the resume. Consider how effectively the resume targets keywords essential for this specific job. 10 = Excellent (Masterful keyword integration demonstrating a deep understanding of job requirements), 1 = Very Poor (Minimal to no alignment with job description keywords).

2. **Reason for Score: Comprehensive Analysis:** Provide a detailed rationale for the score, covering the following aspects:

   - **Relevance and Density of Keywords:** Evaluate the presence and frequency of _highly relevant_ keywords from the job description within the resume. Identify specific examples of strong keyword usage and areas where key terms are noticeably absent.
   - **Quality of Keyword Integration:** Assess how naturally keywords are integrated into the resume content. Is keyword usage contextually relevant and flowing within sentences and bullet points, or does it appear forced or like "keyword stuffing"?
   - **Strategic Placement Analysis:** Analyze the placement of keywords across different resume sections (e.g., Summary/Profile, Skills, Experience, Education). Are the most critical keywords strategically positioned in prominent sections to maximize visibility for both ATS and human reviewers? Identify sections that are particularly strong or weak in keyword optimization.
   - **Identification of Key Missing Keywords (Categorized):** Pinpoint 2-3 _critical_ keywords or keyword phrases from the job description that are significantly missing from the resume. Categorize these missing keywords (e.g., Hard Skills, Soft Skills, Industry-Specific Terms, Technologies, Specific Methodologies) and explain why their inclusion would significantly strengthen the resume's alignment with the job description.
   - **Contextual Understanding of Job Requirements:** Demonstrate an understanding of the underlying job requirements by explaining how the presence or absence of specific keywords impacts the perceived match between the candidate's profile and the job description's needs.

3. **Actionable Improvement Tips: Targeted Recommendations:** Provide concrete and actionable recommendations to significantly enhance keyword optimization:
   - **Specific Keyword and Phrase Suggestions:** Recommend _precise_ keywords and phrases to incorporate, prioritizing those identified as critically missing. Differentiate between essential hard skills, valuable soft skills, and industry-specific terminology.
   - **Section-Specific Placement Strategies:** Advise on the _most effective sections_ to integrate suggested keywords. For example, recommend using the Summary/Professional Profile to front-load the most critical keywords, the Skills section for a comprehensive keyword list, and the Experience section to demonstrate keywords in the context of accomplishments and responsibilities.
   - **Natural Keyword Integration Techniques and Examples:** Provide practical techniques for seamlessly weaving keywords into the resume narrative. Encourage the use of action verbs associated with key skills, quantifying achievements using keywords, and rephrasing existing bullet points to naturally incorporate targeted terms. Offer 1-2 _brief examples_ of how to rewrite a sentence or bullet point to improve keyword integration.
   - **Emphasis on Relevancy and Avoiding Keyword Stuffing:** Reiterate the importance of prioritizing keyword relevance over sheer density. Caution against unnatural keyword stuffing and emphasize maintaining readability and a professional tone.
   - **Iterative Optimization Recommendation:** Suggest that the user view this analysis as a first step in an iterative process. Encourage them to revise their resume based on the feedback and then re-analyze it to measure the improvement in keyword optimization.
