**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Error Detection & Categorization:**

   - Thoroughly analyze the resume text for errors in grammar, spelling, and professionalism of writing style.
   - Categorize the detected errors into specific types (e.g., subject-verb agreement errors, misspelled words - specify examples of misspelled words if possible, informal language, unclear sentence structure).

2. **Score (1-10):**

   - Assess the resume based on the identified errors and overall writing quality.
   - Use a scale of 1-10: 10 = Excellent (no errors detected, highly professional and polished writing), 1 = Very Poor (numerous errors across categories, unprofessional or inappropriate tone).

3. **Reason for Score:**

   - Briefly explain the score.
   - Detail the _types_ of grammar and spelling errors detected (e.g., "Several instances of subject-verb agreement errors were found," "Commonly misspelled words like 'separate' and 'achieve' were present").
   - Comment on the overall tone and level of professionalism, pointing out any specific areas of concern (e.g., "The tone is generally professional but occasionally lapses into informal phrasing," "Sentence structure is sometimes convoluted, making it difficult to understand certain points").

4. **Mistake-Based Tips for Improvement:**
   - Provide actionable tips, with **each tip directly addressing a specific category or type of error detected** in the resume.
   - Frame each tip as a learning point derived from the mistakes found.
   - For each tip, explicitly mention the type of mistake it aims to rectify and suggest how to avoid it in the future.
   - Examples of mistake-based tips:
     - "**Subject-Verb Agreement Errors:** Review subject-verb agreement rules. Pay close attention to ensuring that singular subjects take singular verbs and plural subjects take plural verbs. Proofread sentences carefully to catch these mismatches."
     - "**Common Spelling Mistakes (e.g., 'recieve', 'seperate'):** Create a list of commonly misspelled words and practice spelling them correctly. Utilize spell-check tools, but also manually proofread to catch context-based spelling errors."
     - "**Informal Language:** Replace informal phrases and slang with professional alternatives. For instance, instead of 'gonna' use 'going to', and avoid contractions where possible to maintain a formal tone."
     - "**Unclear Sentence Structure:** Focus on writing concise and direct sentences. Break down overly long or complex sentences into shorter, more manageable units to improve readability and clarity. Ensure each sentence has a clear subject, verb, and object."
     - "**Inconsistent Tense Usage:** Ensure consistent verb tense throughout the resume, especially within each section (e.g., use past tense for previous roles). Review tense consistency to maintain a professional and coherent narrative."
