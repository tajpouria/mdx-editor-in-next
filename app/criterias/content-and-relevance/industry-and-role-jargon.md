**Instructions for AI:**

Your goal is to evaluate and improve the resume's strategic use of industry and role-specific jargon to demonstrate expertise and relevance to potential employers within the target industry and for the specific role outlined in the job description. Consider jargon as a tool to quickly communicate qualifications and industry understanding to those "in the know."

1.  **Jargon Proficiency Score (1-10):** Assign a score from 1 to 10 to represent the resume's current effectiveness in using industry and role-specific jargon. Use the following scale as a guide:

    - **10 - Exceptional:** Jargon is strategically and seamlessly woven throughout the resume, demonstrating deep industry understanding and expertise. Jargon is precise, impactful, and appropriately used for a resume context (not overly technical or exclusionary).
    - **7-9 - Strong:** Good use of relevant jargon, clearly indicating industry awareness. Minor areas for improvement in strategic placement or depth of jargon.
    - **4-6 - Moderate:** Some industry jargon is present, but it may be inconsistently applied, too generic, or lacking impact. The resume could significantly benefit from more targeted jargon.
    - **1-3 - Weak:** Very limited or ineffective use of industry jargon. May use jargon incorrectly, inappropriately, or not at all. The resume largely fails to demonstrate industry-specific expertise through language.

2.  **Justification of Score:** Provide a concise explanation for the assigned score. In your justification, specifically:

    - **Identify Strengths:** Point out instances where the resume effectively uses jargon to highlight skills or experience. Give examples of strong jargon use, if present.
    - **Pinpoint Weaknesses:** Indicate areas where jargon is lacking or could be improved. Be specific about sections of the resume (e.g., Skills, Experience bullet points, Summary) that would benefit from more targeted jargon.
    - **Assess Appropriateness:** Comment on whether the current jargon usage is appropriate for a resume context. Is it too much, too little, or just right? Is any jargon misused or applied incorrectly?

3.  **Actionable Improvement Tips:** Offer at least three (3) concrete, actionable tips to enhance the resume's use of industry jargon. These tips should be immediately implementable and focus on:

    - **Specific Jargon Terms:** Suggest concrete examples of industry-specific jargon terms that could be incorporated. **Prioritize terms that are directly relevant to the provided Job Description and generally recognized as important within the target industry.** If possible, suggest where in the resume these terms would be most impactful (e.g., "Incorporate 'Agile methodologies' into your Skills section and experience bullet points related to project management").
    - **Strategic Placement:** Advise on where in the resume (sections or specific bullet points) the candidate should strategically add or refine jargon to maximize impact.
    - **Refinement & Caution:** Provide guidance on refining existing jargon usage. Caution against common pitfalls like overuse, misuse, or using jargon that is too niche or exclusionary for a general resume review. Explain _why_ these are problematic in a resume context.
