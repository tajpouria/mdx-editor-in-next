Evaluate the provided resume text for appropriate length and structural balance, considering its effectiveness for a typical professional job application. Ideally, perform this evaluation with a target job description in mind (if provided - please include it).

**Resume Text:**

<%= resume_text %>

**Target Job Description:**

<%= job_description_text %>

**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Score (1-10):** Assess the resume's overall length (page count) and the balance in length between sections (e.g., Experience, Skills, Education). Use a general guideline of 1-2 pages for most professionals, adjusting for extensive _relevant_ experience. Consider section proportionality: are sections weighted appropriately based on their likely importance to a recruiter/hiring manager for a typical professional role (or, ideally, for the provided job description)? Use this scale:

   - 10 = Excellent: Ideal length, sections are proportionally sized and logically weighted, demonstrating clear prioritization.
   - 7-8 = Good: Appropriate length, mostly balanced sections, minor improvements possible in proportionality or conciseness.
   - 5-6 = Average: Noticeable imbalances, some sections may be too long or short for typical importance.
   - 3-4 = Below Average: Significant length/balance issues, structure may hinder readability.
   - 1-2 = Very Poor: Inappropriate length, wildly disproportionate sections, ineffective structure.

2. **Reason for Score:** Briefly explain your score. Mention the page count. Specifically comment on whether any sections seem disproportionately long or short _in relation to their likely importance for a job application_ (or, if provided, in relation to the target job description).

3. **Tips for Improvement:** Provide _specific and actionable_ tips to improve resume length and structural balance. Suggest sections to condense or expand, with _examples_ of what to look for (e.g., overly long bullet points in Experience, excessively long Skills lists). If possible, suggest an ideal page count range and areas for focus. If no job description was provided, note that tips are based on general best practices.

**Desired Output Format:**
Score: [Score 1-10]
Reason: [Explanation of score, addressing length and section proportionality]
Tips for Improvement: [Specific, actionable tips for length and balance, potentially suggesting areas to condense/expand, and ideal page count. If no JD, note general advice.] (Use simple text formatting no markdown or HTML or special characters)
