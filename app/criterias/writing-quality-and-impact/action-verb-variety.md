**Prompt Title:** Action Verb Variety and Strength Assessment for Resume Experience Section

**Prompt Instructions:**

Your task is to evaluate the **Experience** section of the provided resume text for the variety and strength of action verbs used to describe responsibilities and achievements.

**Resume Text:**

<%= resume_text %>

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **Action Verb Variety and Strength Score (1-10):**

   - Assess the **variety** of action verbs. Consider if the resume uses a diverse range of verbs or relies on a limited set.
   - Evaluate the **strength** of action verbs. Determine if the verbs are impactful and clearly convey the candidate's actions and contributions. Prioritize action verbs that demonstrate achievement and impact over generic or passive verbs.
   - **Scoring Scale:**
     - **10 = Excellent:** Demonstrates a wide variety of strong and impactful action verbs throughout the Experience section. Verbs are used purposefully to highlight achievements and responsibilities without repetition. Avoids weak or generic verbs.
     - **7-9 = Good:** Generally uses strong action verbs with reasonable variety. Minor areas for improvement may exist, such as occasional repetition or use of slightly weaker verbs in some instances.
     - **4-6 = Fair:** Shows some use of action verbs, but variety is limited and/or weaker, generic verbs are present. Repetition may be noticeable. Significant room for improvement.
     - **1-3 = Poor:** Action verb use is minimal and ineffective. Relies heavily on weak or generic verbs (e.g., "Responsible for," "Assisted with"). Significant repetition and limited vocabulary.
     - **1 = Very Poor:** Almost entirely lacks strong action verbs. Predominantly uses weak or passive phrasing.

2. **Reason for Score (Structured Explanation):** Provide a structured explanation for the assigned score, addressing the following points:

   - **Strengths:** Identify and provide examples of **strong action verbs** used effectively in the resume. Explain _why_ these verbs are effective in conveying impact and achievement.
   - **Weaknesses:** Identify and provide examples of **weak or generic verbs** or instances of **verb repetition**. Explain why these verbs are less impactful and suggest stronger alternatives. Specifically mention if phrases like "Responsible for" or "Assisted with" are overused.
   - **Variety Assessment:** Comment on the overall **variety of action verbs**. Is there a good range of verbs used, or is there a reliance on a limited vocabulary?

3. **Actionable Tips for Improvement (Categorized Suggestions):** Provide concrete and actionable tips categorized to help improve action verb usage:
   - **Enhance Verb Strength:**
     - Suggest specific stronger action verb alternatives for weaker verbs identified in the "Reason for Score."
     - Encourage focusing on verbs that emphasize achievement, initiative, and impact rather than just describing tasks.
   - **Increase Verb Variety:**
     - Recommend using a thesaurus or verb resources to find synonyms and expand action verb vocabulary.
     - Advise against simply replacing verbs with synonyms randomly. Emphasize choosing verbs that are contextually appropriate and accurately reflect the action taken.
   - **Target Common Weak Verbs:**
     - Specifically advise against overuse of phrases like "Responsible for," "Assisted with," "Worked on," "Helped," etc. Provide examples of stronger verbs that could replace these phrases in common resume contexts (e.g., instead of "Responsible for project management," suggest "Managed project timelines and budgets").
   - **Example Strong Action Verbs (Categorized - Optional but helpful):** Provide a short list of strong action verbs categorized by common resume functions (e.g., Leadership: Led, Directed, Guided; Analysis: Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed; Implementation: Implemented, Executed, Launched; Development: Developed, Created, Designed; Communication: Communicated, Presented, Collaborated).
