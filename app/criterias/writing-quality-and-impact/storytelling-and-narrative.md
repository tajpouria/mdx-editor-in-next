**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Narrative Score (1-10):** Assign a score from 1 to 10 based on the strength and clarity of the resume's career narrative and value proposition. Use the following scale as a guide:

   - **10 - Exceptional:** The resume masterfully crafts a compelling and memorable career narrative. Progression is not only logical but impressive, showcasing significant growth and increasing responsibility. The value proposition is highly persuasive and immediately apparent to potential employers.
   - **8-9 - Excellent:** The resume presents a very strong and clear career narrative with logical progression and a well-defined value proposition.
   - **6-7 - Good:** The resume presents a generally coherent career narrative. Progression is evident, and a value proposition is present, though there's room for improvement in clarity and impact.
   - **4-5 - Fair:** The resume presents a basic career narrative, but it may be somewhat generic or lack detail. Progression is visible but not consistently highlighted. A value proposition is present but could be significantly strengthened and clarified.
   - **2-3 - Poor:** The resume struggles to present a clear career narrative. Progression is weak or unclear, and the value proposition is underdeveloped or vague.
   - **1 - Extremely Weak:** The resume is disjointed and lacks any semblance of a career narrative. Progression is absent or illogical. The value proposition is nonexistent, leaving the reader unclear about the candidate's skills or career goals.

2. **Reasoning for Score:** Provide a concise justification for the assigned score. In your reasoning, address the following points:

   - **Career Path Logic:** Is there a clear and logical progression in roles and responsibilities? Explain how the career path unfolds.
   - **Skill Development & Progression:** Does the resume effectively demonstrate the development and progression of skills over time? Are skills built upon in subsequent roles?
   - **Value Proposition Clarity:** How clearly and persuasively is the candidate's value proposition articulated for potential employers? Is it explicit or implied?
   - **Narrative Coherence:** How well does the resume tell a cohesive and engaging story? Are there any disjointed sections or unclear transitions?
   - **Strengths of Narrative (if any):** Point out any specific elements that contribute positively to the narrative's strength (e.g., strong action verbs, quantified achievements, clear career focus in summary).
   - **Weaknesses of Narrative:** Identify specific areas where the narrative is weak, unclear, or missing (e.g., lack of context, generic descriptions, unclear career goal, missing links between experiences).

3. **Actionable Improvement Tips (3-5 points):** Provide **3-5 specific and actionable recommendations** to enhance the resume's career story and narrative. Focus on areas where the candidate can make concrete improvements. Consider suggesting improvements related to:

   - **Strengthening the Career Goal:** How can the candidate clarify their career goal and ensure it's evident throughout the resume?
