**Task:** Critically evaluate resume quantification of experience and achievements, with primary focus on relevance to the job description.

**Inputs:**

- **Resume Text:**

{resume_text}

- **Job Description:**

{job_description_text}

**Instructions for AI:**

1.  **Quantification & Relevance Score (1-10):**

    - **Assess:** To what extent does the resume use **quantifiable metrics, numbers, and data** to describe _relevant_ experience and achievements?
    - **Consider:** Are the quantified achievements **directly aligned** with the **skills and responsibilities** detailed in the job description?
    - **Scoring:**
      - **10 (Excellent):** Experience section is filled with **highly relevant and quantifiable achievements** that **directly and effectively address job description requirements.**
      - **1 (Very Poor):** Experience section exhibits **minimal to no quantifiable achievements,** descriptions are **vague or task-based, and/or achievements are largely irrelevant to the job description.**

2.  **Justification for Score:**

    - **Explain** the assigned score.
    - **Analyze** the **frequency and effectiveness** of _relevant_ quantifiable achievements within the experience descriptions.
    - **Explicitly note** the degree of **alignment with the stated needs of the job description.**
    - **Provide clear examples** of both **strong and weak instances of quantification and relevance.**

3.  **Actionable Improvement Recommendations:**
    - **Offer specific and actionable tips** to significantly improve both experience quantification _and_ relevance to the job description.
    - **Suggest concrete bullet point examples**, demonstrating how to quantify _specific experiences_ using metrics that are **highly relevant and valued according to the job description.**
    - **Advise** on strategically tailoring quantification to **emphatically highlight achievements most likely to be valued** based on the job description.
    - **Encourage** a focused approach on presenting **results that clearly demonstrate impact in areas explicitly identified as important to the employer in the job description.**

**Desired Output Format:**

Score: [Score 1-10]
Reason: [Concise justification of the score]
Tips for Improvement: [Actionable, specific, and relevant recommendations]
