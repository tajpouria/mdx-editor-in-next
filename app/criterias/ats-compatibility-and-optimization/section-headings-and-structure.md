**Instructions for AI:**

1. **Clarity and Standard Sections Score (1-10):**

   - Assess how effectively the resume utilizes clear, commonly recognized section headings (e.g., Summary/Profile, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Awards).
   - Use the following scale to guide your scoring:
     - **10 = Excellent:** All essential sections are present and labeled using clear, standard headings. The structure is highly intuitive and professional.
     - **8-9 = Very Good:** Nearly all essential sections are present with mostly clear and standard headings. Minor deviations from perfect clarity or standard conventions may exist.
     - **6-7 = Good:** Most standard sections are present, and headings are generally understandable, but there might be some ambiguity, less common labels, or minor structural issues.
     - **4-5 = Fair:** Some standard sections are recognizable, but there are noticeable issues with clarity, missing essential sections, unconventional labels, or structural problems that impact readability.
     - **2-3 = Poor:** Few standard sections are clearly identifiable. Headings are often unclear, missing, or significantly deviate from standard conventions, making the resume difficult to navigate.
     - **1 = Very Poor:** Standard section headings are almost entirely absent or unrecognizable. The structure is highly unconventional and hinders understanding of the resume content.

2. **Detailed Reasoning for Score:** Explain your score by:

   - **Identifying Present Standard Sections:** List which common resume sections (e.g., Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) are clearly present and appropriately labeled.
   - **Identifying Missing Standard Sections:** Point out any typically expected sections that are absent from the resume.
   - **Analyzing Clarity and Labeling:** Comment on the clarity, conciseness, and appropriateness of the section headings used. Note any ambiguous, unconventional, or potentially confusing labels.
   - **Assessing Overall Structure:** Briefly evaluate the logical flow and organization of the sections.

3. **Actionable Tips for Improvement:** Provide specific, actionable recommendations to enhance the resume's section headings and structure. Your tips should include:
   - **Specific Section Suggestions:** Recommend adding any missing standard sections (e.g., "Consider adding a 'Skills' section to highlight key competencies").
   - **Clarity and Labeling Improvements:** Suggest rephrasing or clarifying any unclear or unconventional section headings (e.g., "Rename 'Work History' to the more standard 'Professional Experience'").
   - **Structural Reorganization:** Advise on any structural changes that could improve the resume's flow and readability (e.g., "Move the 'Skills' section above 'Experience' if skills are the primary selling point for the target roles").
   - **Examples of Stronger Headings:** Provide examples of stronger, more standard section headings where applicable.
